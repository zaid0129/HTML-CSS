    <p> <strong> <br> <br>What is social media so addicting? <br> <br> </strong>
        While social media can seem like mindless and relaxing fun, it actually has a significant effect on your brain.

        Whenever you log on to your favorite apps, dopamine signals in your brain increase. These neurotransmitters are
        associated with pleasure.

        When you experience more dopamine after using social media, your brain identifies this activity as a rewarding
        one that you ought to repeat. Such a reaction may be more felt whenever you make a post of your own and gain
        positive feedback.

        The positive feelings experienced during social media use are only temporary. The way your brain engages in this
        positive reinforcement is also seen in other addictions.

        Thus, as the feel-good dopamine wears off, you’ll go back to the source (in this case, social media) for more.

        In some cases, social media can be a welcome distraction if you’re isolated due to work or an illness. The more
        you engage, the more your brain will tell you that this is an activity that can help reduce loneliness (which
        may not necessarily be the case, actually).

    <p> <strong> What are the downsides of social media addiction?</strong><br> <br>
        Engaging in social media once in a while is unlikely to be harmful. However, there are negative effects to
        consider when overusing social media.

        Some possible downsides of social media include:

        low self-esteem, which may be prompted by incorrect perceptions that others’ lives are “better” than yours
        increased isolation and loneliness
        anxiety or depression
        onset of social anxiety disorder
        a fear of missing out (FOMO), which can lead to even more social media usage
        disrupted sleep patterns, especially if you use social media right before bedtime
        decreased physical activity, which may affect your overall health
        poor grades or work performance
        ignoring the relationships in your “real” life
        reduced ability to empathize with others

    <p> <strong> How can you decrease social media use?</strong><br> <br>

        Whether you have social media addiction or are just on your apps more than you need to be, the good news is
        there are ways you can help decrease your overall use.

        Consider the following tips to help you achieve a healthier balance with social media:

        Delete your social media apps from your smartphone. While you can still access them from your personal computer,
        keeping them off your phone may help decrease the amount of time spent on social media overall.
        Turn off your personal phone during work, as well as during school, meals, and recreational activities. You can
        also adjust the setting on each social media app so you can turn off certain notifications.
        Set aside a certain amount of time dedicated to social media per day. Turn on a timer to help keep you
        accountable.
        Leave your phone, tablet, and computer out of your bedroom.
        Take up a new hobby that’s not technology-related. Examples include sports, art, cooking classes, and more.
        Make it a point to see your friends and family in person when possible.
        It’s also important to take regular breaks from social media altogether to help find some real-life grounding.

        Depending on your needs, your break can last for 1 day per week, a whole month, or an entire season. Let
        yourself be in control of this decision — not your social media account.
