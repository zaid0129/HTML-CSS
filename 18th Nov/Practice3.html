    <u> <h1> <em>  Web development </em>  </h1> </u>
    <p>  <strong>What is Web Devlopment <br> <br>  </strong>    Web development refers to the process of building and maintaining websites or web applications that are accessible through the internet. It involves a variety of tasks, ranging from designing the user interface (UI) to developing the server-side logic that powers the functionality of a site. Web development can be broken down into two main categories:
    <br> <br> <strong>1.  Frontend</strong> <br> 
<br> <strong> 2. Backend  </strong> <br> <br> <strong> 3. Full-Stack Development  </strong> <br>  <br> <strong> 4. Web Development Frameworks and Tools  </strong> <br> </p>
    <p>  <strong> 1. Front-End Development (Client-Side):  </strong>        <br> <br> 
        Front-end development involves everything the user interacts with directly in their web browser. It focuses on creating the visual layout, the structure of the web pages, and the overall user experience (UX). The tools and languages commonly used in front-end development include:
        
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The basic building block of web pages, defining the structure.
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Used to style the content and layout, including colors, fonts, and spacing.
        JavaScript: A programming language used to add interactivity to a webpage, such as form validation, dynamic content updates, and animations.
        Frameworks and Libraries: Tools like React, Angular, or Vue.js can streamline and simplify front-end development.
    <p> <strong> 2. Back-End Development (Server-Side): </strong><br> <br>      
        Back-end development focuses on the server-side of web applications, which involves building the logic, databases, and server interactions that power the front-end. It includes:
        
        Server-side languages: Like Python, Ruby, PHP, Node.js, Java, or C# for processing requests from the user and sending responses back to the front-end.
        Databases: Storing, retrieving, and manipulating data using systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.
        Server Management: Ensuring that the website or application runs smoothly on a web server, such as those powered by technologies like Apache or Nginx.
         </p>    
    </p> <strong> 3. Full-Stack Development: </strong><br> <br> A full-stack developer works on both the front-end and back-end aspects of a website or application. They have a broad understanding of both sides and can build complete web solutions from start to finish.</p>
    <p> <strong> 4. Web Development Frameworks and Tools: </strong><br> <br>Frameworks are pre-built sets of tools and libraries that make the development process faster and more efficient. Some examples:

        For Front-End: React, Angular, Vue.js, Bootstrap.
        For Back-End: Django (Python), Express.js (Node.js), Ruby on Rails, Laravel (PHP).
        Database: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL.
